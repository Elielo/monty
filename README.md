# monty
monty.c is a representation of the monty probability problem, where there are three doors.
One holds a prize, and the other two hold nothing. You choose a door. Then, a door without a prize is revealed, 
and you are asked if you would like to switch. Although surprising, you are more likely to win if you switch. 

I didn't really believe this so I created monty.c, and then ran 10,000 trials.
